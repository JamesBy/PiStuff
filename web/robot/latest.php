        <p>So the camera works, the motors work, time to get the servos working.</p>
        <P>The method is similar to the motors. There is a switch on the dashboard to change the function of the touchpad from motor operation to servos or vice versa.</P>
        <img src="img/dashsnip.png" class="img-responsive">
        <p>With the servos now working its time to change the configuration of the robot. I am going to mount the servos at the back of the robot and mount the camera on the serovs. This will enable the user to look around the robot as well as at the robot itself... in case it gets stuck!</p>
